That gives 8. Then, I need to multiply that result by 8. Wait, the user wrote (3 + 5) * 8, so the second operand is 8. So after getting 8 from the addition, I should multiply by 8. But in my previous tool calls, I added 3+5 first, which is correct. Then the next step is to take the result of that addition (which is 8) and multiply it by 8. So the multiply function should have a=8 and b=8. That would give 64. The user's final answer should be 64. Let me check if the tool responses were correct. The add function returned 8, then the multiply function with 8 and 8 gives 64. Yep, that's right. So the final answer is 64.\n",
