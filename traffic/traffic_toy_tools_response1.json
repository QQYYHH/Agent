                "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants me to calculate (3 + 5) * 8. Hmm, first I need to figure out the order of operations here. The expression inside the parentheses is 3 + 5, which should be done first. So 3 plus 5 equals 8. Then, I multiply that result by 8. Wait, so that's 8 multiplied by 8. But wait, maybe I should check if the functions available can handle this.\n\nLooking at the tools provided, there's add, multiply, and divide functions. The add function takes two integers, so I can use that for 3 and 5. Then, the multiply function would take the result of that addition and multiply by 8. So first, call add with a=3 and b=5. That gives 8. Then, call multiply with a=8 (the result from add) and b=8. That should give 64. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to do it in one step, but the functions don't have a combined operation. So I need to break it down into two steps. First add 3 and 5, then multiply the sum by 8. Yep, that's the correct approach. Let me make sure I'm using the right parameters for each function. The add function's parameters are a and b, both integers. Multiply also takes a and b as integers. So the first tool call is add with 3 and 5, then multiply with the result and 8. Alright, that should work.\n",
